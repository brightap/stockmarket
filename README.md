# Stock Market Analysis
in this portfolio project, i used some data from the stock market; some technology stocks. I used pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it and finally did some risk analysis.
Below are the calculations i made

    1. the change   in price of the stock over time
    2. the daily return of the stock on average
    3. moving average of the various stocks
    4. The correlation between different stocks' closing prices
    5. The correlation between different stocks' daily prices
